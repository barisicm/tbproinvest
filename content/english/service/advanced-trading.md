### Advanced Trading

Education on different types and methods of trading on stock markets. What do you aim to achieve and whether you want to be a day trader or occasional trader? How to recognize an opportunity when it arises and obtain all the necessary information to be successful in trading securities. And to be more successful than large and sluggish funds. To have a firm hand when needed and to isolate external factors from the market.

The service is charged per hour of education.
