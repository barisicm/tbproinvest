**Binance**, the world's largest crypto exchange, will pay the largest fine in history.

It's a settlement of $4.2 billion that founder **Changpeng Zhao** has agreed to settle and step down from his position as CEO, admitting guilt.

Binance violated the law by not implementing an effective anti-money laundering program.
Many users were allowed to trade without a KYC (Know Your Customer) system.

Through this lack of control, **Binance** gained a certain market advantage, and certain criminal users and companies benefited from these unregulated transactions.

Earlier checks were carried out on **Binance**, and the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** also investigated other crypto exchanges, such as **Coinbase, Bittrex, and Kraken**, which faced similar accusations. 

Stronger and better regulation is needed to protect users and their assets.
