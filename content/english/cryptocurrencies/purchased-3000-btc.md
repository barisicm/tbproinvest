MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 3,000 BTC, and it seems that Michael Saylor has fulfilled his promise when he recently said he plans to buy BTC indefinitely. 

They recently acquired a new quantity at an average price of $51,000, which would mean they paid about $155 million for it. Currently, they own 193,000 bitcoins which they have paid a total of $6.09 billion for, at an average price of $31,500. 

At current market prices, their investment is worth over $11 billion, and their net return exceeds 70%. An outstanding deal that will be even better in the future, as BTC could achieve a stronger growth as early as next week.
