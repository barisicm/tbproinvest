The staking platform shared data indicating that 25% of the total Ethereum supply has been removed from the market and is currently being staked.

It is estimated that over $70 billion is currently staked at these current prices, securing the network with over 940,000 validators.

The inflation rate of ETH stands at -0.57% annually, and the price has reached $2,450, with an increase of over 4% in the last 24 hours.

The value is half of its All-Time High (ATH) of $4,800 at its peak, and the news that a spot ETF for ETH is very likely to be launched in May or June 2024 could further increase the price and bring in substantial profits during this and the following year.
