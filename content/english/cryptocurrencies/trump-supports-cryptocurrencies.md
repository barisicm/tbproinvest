It's no small matter that a former, and very possibly future, **American president, Donald Trump**, publicly speaks out in support of cryptocurrencies.

If elected, he would support **digital assets**, as he himself invests in cryptocurrencies and, as he stated, plays with these new crazy currencies. People love them and use them - he said. 

Trump owns assets worth about $8.7 million, mostly from selling NFTs. 

In December 2023, Trump cashed out $2.4 million from an **ETH wallet**. 

His recent experiences have brought him closer to this type of digital asset, towards which he was skeptical not so long ago. He is not an opponent of traditional currencies and wants the dollar to be strong and stable, but he believes that cryptocurrencies are already seriously present and here to stay.

Also, considering that American power lies not only in military strength but mostly because of the **US dollar**, which is the world's number one trading currency, it's a question of how he will be able and have to position himself regarding cryptocurrencies if he becomes president again.
