This cryptocurrency, which aims to incentivize a global network of computers by providing reliable information from around the world via smart contracts on the blockchain, recently unlocked over 19 million LINK tokens - equivalent to over $340 million.

Their decentralized approach ensures the integrity and reliability of the provided information and reduces the risk of error and manipulation. Most of these funds were released on the Binance exchange.

The price movement of LINK tokens has had a positive trend in recent weeks of trading. 

In the last month, the price has risen from $13 to as high as $19.70, currently sitting at $18.40. It is currently the 12th cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which exceeds $10 billion.

Certainly, a cryptocurrency worth keeping an eye on in the future.
