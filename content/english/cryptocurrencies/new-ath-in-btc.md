Strong growth of BTC in this 2024 year are record investments of the most powerful players in the global capital markets.


New All-time high (ATH) in the bitcoin market from the record set there in 2021. BTC has exceeded $68,900, and now everyone wants to participate, panic has taken over because the fear of missing out on profit is great. Just compared to last month, BTC has grown by over 40%. 


The reasons for such high growth, alongside the upcoming halving, are the relaxation of monetary policy in China and increased purchases of digital assets, mainly BTC and stocks. In addition, large ETF funds with enormous amounts under management have received the green light and started buying and securing their position in the market.


Opponents are becoming quieter, and if they continue to refuse to enter the world of blockchain and digital assets, they could find themselves on the losing side. They are lulled into their dominant position and think that the crypto market is irrelevant. Sobering up, if it hasn't already arrived for some, could be too late.
