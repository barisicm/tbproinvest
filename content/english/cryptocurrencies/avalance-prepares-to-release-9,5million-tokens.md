The **blockchain** platform is preparing for significant development in February. The expected release of various projects is valued at around $900 million. The moment when this value is expected to be released is February of this year.

**AVAX** plans to release 9.5 million tokens worth around $320 million on February 22, 2024, while **Aptos** plans to release 24.8 million tokens worth around $230 million on February 11, 2024.

All these announcements have put the crypto community and investors on alert. With such large quantities and values entering the markets, they could affect the value of projects as well as general stability. For the crypto world, this is certainly positive news, but the question is how it will affect the value of **AVAX**.

They recently attracted market attention with extraordinary growth of over 450%, but now they are in a downward trend they want to exit. Meanwhile, they have grown exponentially and are now the sixth-largest DeFi network and the ninth cryptocurrency by market capitalization exceeding $12 billion USD in total.

An important piece of information is that the last time they unlocked tokens, the price experienced a 16% drop, falling from $23 USD to less than $19 USD. The recommendation is to be cautious and consider all possibilities that could happen with **AVAX** this month.

The current price of **AVAX** is $34.40 USD.
