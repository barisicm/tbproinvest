The government of the **Republic of Korea** is considering the possibility of introducing spot ETFs in their country.

Cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and new technologies have always been closely linked with South Korea, and this possibility only confirms that they continue in the same direction. Reports suggest that there could be approval for the sale of spot **Bitcoin ETFs**. 

Authorities have stated that they plan to regulate this market and have expressed concern about the intermediary sale of spot Bitcoin ETFs. 

All of this is expected for the second half of this year, but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also approved the trading of Bitcoin ETFs in the country. For now, the SEC is still postponing a decision on BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF, but there is a good chance that it will be approved soon. 

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has already surpassed $71,000, with experts predicting further growth, possibly exceeding $80,000, or even $90,000. 

In the Tether market, the largest stablecoin issuer, the market value exceeds $100 billion, which is a good indicator that USDT is preparing for new investors and an influx of new liquidity into the crypto market.
