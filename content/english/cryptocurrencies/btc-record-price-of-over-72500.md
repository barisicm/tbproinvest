**Bitcoin** has reached a new record level of over $72,500, and one of the reasons is that the financial regulator in the United Kingdom has stated that it will allow trading of securities backed by cryptocurrencies.

The financial regulator in the UK stated that it will not oppose investment exchanges creating a market segment for records traded on crypto assets (CETNs), which can be traded like stocks.
However, this is not permitted for small investors and the general public. The UK regulator continues to warn about the risks of investing in digital assets.

It could be interpreted as allowing the wealthy and the financial and banking sector to become even wealthier, while leaving small investors behind.

Analysis and planning need to be done, but risk must be taken to achieve financial gain.

Similar warnings are also coming from the American SEC. Of course, **caution is necessary**, and buying at record levels of any asset, including digital ones, is not a good idea from an investment perspective.

**But with BTC, you never know how far and how long they could continue to rise; there is certainly still plenty of room**.
