Billionaire Peter Thiel invested over $200 million in BTC and ETH just before the price increase and the start of the BULL market.

Looking at data from COIN MARKET CAP, BTC has risen over 120%, while ETH has risen over 75% in the last year.

Founders Fund, a venture capital company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, is reinvesting in crypto. He began buying BTC below $30,000, while today, 1 BTC is worth more than $50,000.

The billionaire has often criticized central banks and has long advocated for crypto investments. In 2021, he stated that even a small portion of his portfolio is invested in digital assets.

In early 2022, Founders Fund sold most of its crypto assets worth $1.8 billion, but during 2023, it bought and increased investments. It seems to have made an excellent move, which could be even more profitable soon.

BTC has risen over 5% in the last few days and has exceeded $50,000 for the first time since 2021.
The rise of crypto is also favored by expectations of interest rate cuts by the FED and ECB during this year.
