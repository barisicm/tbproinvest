Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is experiencing new growth and its highest price in the last year.

Currently standing at $0.11 USD, in just the past week, when the rest of the crypto market slowed down, HBAR continued its upward trajectory, growing by over 30%.
The reason behind this is that HBAR is developing new partnerships and projects. 

The latest collaboration is with the food giant Mondelez International. An agreement has been reached for the development of distributed ledger technology solutions for internal use.

Various industry leaders such as Dell, Google, IBM, Ubisoft, Deutsche Telekom, and many others utilize the Hedera network.

Mondelez International is a global food leader responsible for many popular brands.

"We are excited to amplify their voice as part of the Hedera Council in guiding relevant business solutions for the larger CPG and retail ecosystem."

They aim to enhance their logistical capabilities and eagerly anticipate this partnership, believing that jointly developed solutions will address long-standing production challenges.

According to everything, HBAR is doing a good job and continuing in the right direction, which could be promising for its investors in the future.
