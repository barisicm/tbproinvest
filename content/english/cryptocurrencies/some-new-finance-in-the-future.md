For a long time, most people denied and refused to accept the following fact, which is that cryptocurrencies are here and they are here to stay. 

With more regulation, a more organized market, banks have realized that if they don't have this type of digital asset, they could lose a good share of the market. The race is on, some are in a better position, some in a worse, and time will show everything as usual. 

Digital EURO is approaching, will we have cash registers in the future? Probably not, and how will artificial intelligence (AI) fit into all this? 

More than 26,000 small startups worldwide want to design and develop new financial and technological solutions, and the number will likely continue to grow, and the future holds inevitable changes. Today, we can already say that most things are available with just a click.

Consumer habits have already changed quite a bit, and as generations come, changes are even greater. Our society and lives are much more dynamic, we want everything and immediately. All users seek simplicity, and whoever manages to fulfill it with their ideas and solutions will create a new boom. Both entrepreneurs and users want the ability to pay with cryptocurrencies, and soon the digital EURO will arrive.
