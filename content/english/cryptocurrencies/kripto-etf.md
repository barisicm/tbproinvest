The United States is the largest home to over 3000 **ETF** funds according to 2023 data.

Spot ETFs from **Fidelity** and **BlackRock** had the highest January inflows and now amount to a total of $4.8 billion, just the beginning, and will surely strengthen their positions in the coming months.

On the other hand, the **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)** had the second-largest outflow, with an estimated net outflow of around $5.7 billion from the fund during the first month of 2024, which is the reason for the current price of bitcoin, which could experience new highs once their sell-off ends. If not during this year, then certainly in 2025.

This report from Morningstar comes during a period when **ETF funds** have recorded 6 consecutive days of net positive inflows totaling over $700 million.

Inflows from new **ETF funds** have exceeded the long-term outflows of GBTC, so the turning point is already here, and expectations are high.
