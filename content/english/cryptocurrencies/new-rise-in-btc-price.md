The price has exceeded $53,000, which is the highest price in the past year and a growth of over 250%. ETF funds have played a significant role, perhaps the most significant, having exceeded $3 billion in inflows in one month since approval.

This marks the beginning of a positive trend that started in 2024 and is good news for all crypto investors. This increase is despite Grayscale selling its shares; without that sale, we might already be at a new All-Time High (ATH) for BTC.

The inflow, excluding Grayscale, amounts to about $10 billion.

Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $30 billion in digital assets, which is roughly over 680,000 BTC.
Currently, the Spot ETF BTC has become the second-largest ETF in the U.S., while gold still holds the top position with assets of over $90 billion.

For how long? What will the price of BTC be? We have yet to follow and see.
