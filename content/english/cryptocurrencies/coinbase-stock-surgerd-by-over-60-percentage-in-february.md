The second-largest crypto exchange, **Coinbase**, is experiencing a surge and explosion in demand for their shares.

As Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and most significant cryptocurrency in the world, has been growing in recent months, reaching its highest level in the past two years, this strong demand has spilled over to exchanges, which have excellent volumes and earnings.

Given that everyone now suddenly wants to participate in the crypto market and buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies so as not to miss out on growth and profit opportunities, there has been a record influx and overload on Coinbase due to new users.

Literally, a parallel can be drawn between the price of **Coinbase** stock and BTC.
Expectations, both of analysts and investors, are that the price of the stock and the entire crypto market will continue to rise.

How long and to what level remains to be seen. It is inevitable that there will have to be a correction sooner or later, but the trend is upward and will continue to be upward.

**We are warming up for what is yet to come**.
