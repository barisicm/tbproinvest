The halving is approaching, and analysts predict that the price could reach $70,000.

A very cautious and modest estimate considering that we have approved ETF funds and new inflows of funds into the crypto market, with more expected. Alongside the halving, there is an expectation of interest rate cuts, and geopolitical events favor digital assets.

The banking sector, which has enormous assets, will surely see opportunities and potential for profit in crypto.

At the global level, ownership currently stands at 10%, and if cryptocurrency owners were to invest just 1% of their income into crypto, this would mean an annual inflow of over $50 billion or $150 million daily.

Not long ago, we were at $30,000, just 10 days ago at $40,000, and now we are already over $50,000.
ETF funds already exceed supply in a ratio of 2:1, and we are just at the beginning. We have yet to see where this high demand will take us.
