**BlackRock's ETF** already owns over 196,000 BTC, surpassing **MicroStrategy**, which has collected 193,000 pieces so far but over a much longer period.

MicroStrategy began collecting BTC quantities back in 2020, while **BlackRock** accumulated this quantity over the past 3 months. The fact is that demand is high, likely to be even higher, and enthusiasm is driving the market.

The all-time high (ATH) has already been reached, and everything indicates that we will see new record prices for this digital asset.

ETF experts point out that the inflow of these 9 new spot ETFs in the last 2 months has exceeded the inflow into all gold ETFs over the past 5 years. 

The cumulative trading volume for ETFs has exceeded **$100 billion**. For now, these 9 hold 4% of the BTC supply, and the result of all this is the ATH on BTC, and soon we could see new record levels.
