Another step towards managing emotional reactions is setting clear goals and strategies. When you have a clear investment plan and defined goals, it's easier to avoid impulsive reactions to short-term changes in the market.

Finally, it's important to have realistic expectations and accept the fact that there will be fluctuations in investing.

In summary, awareness of how your psyche affects your investment decisions and developing strategies for managing emotions are key elements of successful investing.
