We all invest throughout our lives, but each of us usually focuses on one type of investment or maybe several types. 

>We all invest our time, knowledge, money. What makes a difference is how much time we invest, how much we invest in our knowledge, how much money we have, and then what to invest in and how much?
 
The key to everything is to invest, to have that **constant and discipline**, so whatever opportunities allow, someone is willing to invest more time, someone has more opportunities to invest in knowledge, someone may have more **financial resources to invest**, or other assets. The point is definitely investing. Without constant investment, there is no future prosperity.
 
One should think about the return on **your investment**, it is not the same whether you need to invest hours, days, months, or years in something. Are you investing hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands? How long will you need to educate yourself to gain certain knowledge or skills? And how much time will it take to recoup that investment?
 
As a society, we dabble in everything and have certain superficial knowledge in everything instead of focusing on what we are best at, and allowing others to do what they are best at because only in this way can we as a society derive the greatest benefit both personally and as a whole society.
