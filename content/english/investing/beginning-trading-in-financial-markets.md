Every year, many try, and most give up after a short period. They give up because new investors enter with money but without knowledge. Usually, they leave without money but with knowledge, and many even without knowledge. 

**By trading on global financial markets**, you enter a battle with large companies backed by big money, with dozens of top experts with knowledge and experience in the business.

However, with learning, **developing your knowledge and skills**, your chances of success increase. With discipline, a good plan, and knowledge, your chances are in your favor. Most don't understand the cause and effect and why certain things happen and what the reasons are. 

**Don't despair**; everyone has been at the beginning at some point. 

Start the path of self-help and learn the relationship between the value of money and your own worth.

1.**Open an account**, find a platform, for starters, invest imaginary money, try how the market works. Familiarize yourself with the interface: how to buy, how to sell, how to place orders.

2.**Learn to read financial reports**, read financial articles, books about stock exchanges and trading. What's usually most convenient and cheapest usually means greater financial loss. **Investment in knowledge** and honing your skills means long-term success.

3.Learn to analyze, charts, technical data. Indicators in financial reports of companies can give you a better picture of whether a company can expect growth and development in the future, and thus whether you can benefit financially. Think about your short-term, medium-term, and **long-term plan**. Look at movements by the hour, day, week, and what the trends are.

4.**Practice trading**, try virtual trading without risk. Try it out and see if it's something for you. Are you disciplined and focused enough on your plan and ultimate goal? Practicing on a virtual platform can save you a lot of money and help you learn where all the pitfalls and challenges are on that path.

5.**Find a mentor**, someone who has been through it all in the market, someone who has experienced both losses and gains and who can help you achieve your goals and ultimate financial freedom with their knowledge and experience. Learning from your own mistakes can be very expensive.

Risk management when you start investing real money.

Each position carries technical parameters that help with timely entry or exit from a particular position and how to achieve that.

**Stick to the plan and goals**, hoping that neither fear nor greed will pull you
