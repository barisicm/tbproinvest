A study in itself and a skill best acquired in practice on real examples rather than in theory. 

It involves a lot of data, indicators, charts, and information.

The goal of each **technical analysis** of individual stocks, commodities, currencies, and **cryptocurrencies** should be to assist in the timing of entry or exit from a particular **investment**.

A more advanced analysis, but also much riskier, would be in daily trading between different pairs. It's a skill that requires a lot of time and **knowledge investment**, but once mastered, it can bring significant financial **benefits to your finances**.

There will always be both successful and unsuccessful trades. The essence and purpose of technical analysis are to increase and maximize the number of successful trades while reducing and minimizing the number of losses.

By doing so systematically and disciplining yourself with adequate education, **financial gain is possible**.
