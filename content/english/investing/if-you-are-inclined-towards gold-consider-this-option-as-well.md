Are you an **investor** who enjoys precious metals and invests in gold, or are you just planning to enter into a position as part of your portfolio?

Perhaps this year, we have a better investment option with the potential for higher returns, and that is **silver**. 

The price of silver could reach its **highest level in the last 10 years**.

Global demand could reach 1.2 billion ounces, which would signify the highest demand ever recorded, and consequently, prices could surpass $30 per ounce, a level last seen in 2013.

**Increased demand** for silver jewelry in India is expected, and growth is also anticipated in the electronics market.

The obstacle that has occurred is the slowing growth of the Chinese economy, as well as uncertainty about the interest rate that the Fed will set.

Silver tends to outperform gold prices during stronger economic expansions but also declines during economic difficulties.

Currently, it takes 90 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. It might not be a bad idea to divide a portion of **your portfoxlio** designated for gold and invest partially in silver.
