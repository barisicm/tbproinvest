All economic and geopolitical indicators suggest that the price of gold could continue to rise in the new year. 

**Gold** is always an interesting market for investors and recommended precisely because of various possible market shocks, potential uncertainties, and events that do not affect the value of your investment in gold so much.

It provides a kind of security and **stability for your portfolio**, serving as a new beginning if you lose part of your funds in riskier investments.

In 2023, despite some fluctuations, gold ended with a nice average growth of 9%. World economies have been struggling on multiple fronts in recent years, and challenges are always significant, with shocks being possible and not so rare when you look at the recent past.

Always keep in mind when investing never to **invest** in markets at the peak of their historical value because remember, everyone is ahead of you.

Considering fundamental analysis and unstable geopolitical factors, further growth in gold prices can be expected. In some pessimistic predictions, growth of 2-3% is anticipated, while more optimistic forecasts suggest double-digit percentage growth in the price of gold.

Certainly, the impact on the price will also be influenced by the interest rate policy in America by the Fed, especially if there is a reduction in **interest rates**, which markets expect this year, and which should be paid attention to and monitored throughout the year.
