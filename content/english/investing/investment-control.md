Our biggest enemies in investing are ourselves.

By controlling and **disciplining ourselves**, we achieve the greatest financial benefits and **financial freedom**.

Greed and fear are always present in financial marketsâ€”both extremes can pull an undecided, undisciplined investor without a plan.
 
**Always make a plan**, step by step, without skipping steps.Money should work for you, and you shouldn't be afraid of money.

Realistic goals and a good plan are half the success, something I've learned from 20 years of experience in investing in various types of assets.

**You can minimize all investment risks by investing in yourself**. Financial literacy reduces these risks and gives you an advantage over others, increasing your chances of success.
