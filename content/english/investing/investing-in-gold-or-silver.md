**Every investment is good**; the question is only how risky it is and what returns can be expected. Of course, the higher the risk, the greater the opportunities for profit as well as the potential for loss, but this type of investment is certainly not one of the highly risky ones.

>This is an investment that will not make you rich, but it will certainly give your portfolio a certain security, stability, and resilience to possible market shocks.

**Silver**, and especially **gold**, has always had its popularity and there will always be investors in this type of asset. Given that it is limited, it will always have value. 

**Profitability** is certainly higher than depositing money in banks or buying bonds that are not able to preserve the value of your money. And the risks are similar, maybe even smaller because you don't deal with banks.

The price of gold has risen by more than 450% in recent years, which on average means more than 8.5% per year. 

Usually, this type of investment is more for long-term investors who have a long-term plan and goal. An important aspect of this story is also the fact that it is **non-taxable and very liquid assets**.

Another thing that favors this type of investment is that our parents, grandparents have changed 3-4 or even more currencies that are worthless today or their purchasing power has drastically decreased. But for your gold or silver, you will always get value. The process of investing in this type of asset is quite simple, easy, and accessible.

In conclusion, regardless of what type of **investor you are**, consider converting a portion of your portfolio into this type of asset.
