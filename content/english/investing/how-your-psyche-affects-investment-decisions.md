A topic that is rarely discussed and not given much importance, yet it is actually very important and extensive and can influence your decision-making, and ultimately whether your investment will be successful or not. It is good that it, like everything else, can be practiced and learned to control.

>It is important to be aware that your emotions affect your decisions because then you can confront them. 

**Focus on the long term and the goal you have**. If you have made a good plan and conducted all the research properly, and performed fundamental and technical analysis, short-term movements and extraordinary situations should not lead you to act impulsively. If **emotions** influence your investment decision, there is a high chance that the decision will be wrong.

Psychological influences that affect decisions can be:

-Risk aversion, where the opportunity for profit is missed due to fear of loss. Diversify and understand your risk tolerance.

-Overconfidence, which believes it can always beat the market and make the best decisions. Regularly objectively evaluate your results to avoid this influence.

-Loss aversion, where investors remain in losing positions thinking they will recover, which can lead to greater losses.**Clearly define boundaries** (STOP/LOSS).
    
-Herd behavior, where you follow others.

-Confirmation bias, where selectively seeking information that confirms your decision. Seek other opinions and strive to objectively assess.

-Emotional reactions of fear and greed, which you can best resolve by having a plan, strategy, and goal.

-Recent event bias, which is best mitigated by the long-term perspective.

-Cognitive dissonance when you realize your **attitudes and behaviors** do not match. It is crucial to recognize and **adjust strategies**.

-Hindsight bias when past events were not predictable and cannot be influenced. Make more realistic assessments for the future and move forward.

-Regret aversion—avoid potential regret, diversification, and discipline will help mitigate this bias.
 
A **successful investor** is aware of the possibility of their mistakes and the psychological impact on the decision-making process. How to mitigate and control them can be achieved through **discipline, education, diversification, and seeking expert advice and assistance**.
