The US should certainly avoid a crisis and recession, with American stock market indices at record levels, despite minor corrections.

The price of Bitcoin is also at historically highest levels, while **gold**, which is the oldest known investment considered as insurance against other market losses, is also gaining in value.

This kind of situation doesn't occur often. Usually, each asset has its own cycle, and if some cycles align, they don't align for all **investment assets**.

The **price of gold** is at a record amount of $2,195 per ounce.

Since the beginning of the year, there has been a 5% increase, while on an annual basis, it appears to be an incredible 19%. Most investors are surprised by this price of this precious metal. There are several explanations for the situation. Inflation is still present, and a good portion of investors wants to preserve their **purchasing power**. Geopolitical circumstances also favor the rise in the price of gold. 

Additionally, **a reduction in interest rates** has been announced, which will further lower returns on government bonds.

Will the growth slow down? Probably yes, but gold remains an attractive investment.
