We know that states and investors do not have friends, only interests, but this relationship, besides being beneficial for its participants, is also good for the whole world.

How and why is that? Well, if there were no buyers for Russian oil and gas, the prices of these commodities would likely not be at the current levels.

**The Middle East** would surely take advantage of this, as OPEC has threatened, cut production, and blackmailed, and wise Arabs could have secured perhaps double the current price per barrel. Over the past year, the price has fluctuated between 70-90 USD per barrel, but it could possibly reach levels of 150, maybe even 200 USD.

Since the Russian invasion of **Ukraine** and various sanctions imposed on **Russia** by the West, the main buyers of cheap Russian energy have become India and the black market. India has almost completely halted procurement from Middle Eastern countries, and India could soon become one of the largest global consumers of oil.

India aims for its own energy independence and plans to achieve this in the next 5-6 years. Their economy is growing, as is the need for energy, so Indian plans are very ambitious, and with the help of cheap Russian energy, they could achieve this.

Good news for **Russia**, **India**, and indirectly for the whole world, let's be honest, because whatever we think about certain actions and decisions of individual countries, usually no one wants to overpay for energy, which is still the main driver of all world economies.

And let's face it, everyone looks out for their own interests.
