The majority of investments in energy are allocated to **solar power plants**. The energy sector has been the most active part of the economy for some time now, leading in new investments.

Among them are **HEP, INA, ENNA Group**, and other companies, with total investments this year expected to exceed one billion euros. Everyone aims to reduce energy costs in operations and rely less on external sources by investing in their own sources.

Leading the pack is the **HEP Group**, which anticipates investments totaling 630 million euros, with 140 million euros planned for the construction of a new block of the Trešnjevka thermal power plant.

Regarding renewable energy sources, the commencement of operations of the Radosavci and Jambrek solar power plants is planned, along with the completion of the construction of the Črnkovci solar plant, with new projects set to commence.

The main collaboration is with **Končar**, and in addition to several projects with HEP, Končar plans to complete the construction of a wind farm near Sinj, with an investment of 26 million euros.

**INA** has initiated a 600 million euro investment in the Rijeka refinery, which is expected to be completed this year, while oil and gas exploration is set to start with an investment of around 100 million euros. INA also plans to invest in renewable energy sources, notably the solar power plant in Sisak with a capacity of over 2600 megawatts, which will be one of the largest in Croatia.

**ENNA Group**, the largest private energy company, plans to invest one billion euros over the next 5 years, primarily in the solar business and geothermal energy. An IPO is planned to raise funds, and the company already has concessions for geothermal energy exploration fields in Slovenia.

Smaller investors also plan to transition to green energy, with investments ranging from 200 to 500 million euros, including **JANAF**,**Slovenian PETROL**, and 166 companies that have applied for incentives to invest in solar systems and renewable sources, partly financed from their own funds.
